# neo4j-traversal-procedure

This project demos the usage of Neo4j's traversal API together with a branch state. The code example is built into a stored procedure `treeAsNestedMap` that traverses down a tree hierarchy and collects all nodes into a nested map.

For usage, see link:src/test/groovy/TraversalSpec.groovy[]
